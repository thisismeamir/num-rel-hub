# Numerical Relativity Hub - `scripts/`

This folder contains all utility scripts, including pre-processing and post-processing scripts, monkey patches, and other small tools that enhance the performance and usability of the main projects.

## Navigating:
- [Analysis Scripts](./analysis) Scripts for analyzing data from simulations or experiments.
- [Enhancement Scripts](./enhancement) Scripts that modify or optimize the behavior of the main projects.

Scripts in these folders are designed to be reusable across multiple projects. You can contribute your own scripts to improve the processing pipeline or enhance existing projects.

How to contribute:
1. Add new scripts to the appropriate subfolder based on functionality.
2. Ensure that each script is documented with clear usage instructions.
3. Maintain consistency with the existing script structures for easy integration.
