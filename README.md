# Numerical Relativity Hub

Welcome to **Numerical Relativity Hub**, an educational and project repository focused on the fields of **numerical relativity, cosmology, and astrophysics**. This repository serves as a central, version-controlled location for all the research materials, source codes, simulations, and documentation generated through my work. 

The structure of this repository is designed to separate educational content from project-specific work, allowing for better organization, clarity, and collaboration. Some folders in this repository are **git submodules**, representing larger projects or collaborations with other people or organizations.

## Repository Structure:

### [[Docs]]
This directory contains all written materials, ranging from small notes to full papers.
- [Notes](./notes): Short letters or informal notes that serve as quick references or observations.
- [Reports](./reports): Progress reports or detailed documentation of the research process.
- [Papers](./papers): Formal papers covering larger materials or detailed analysis of specific problems.


###  [[Sources]]
The source code for each standalone project or library Iâ€™m developing.
- **project1/**: An example of a project folder. Each project folder is independent and has a specific goal, whether it's developing a library or solving a particular problem in numerical relativity.
- **project2/**: Another example of a standalone project.

### [[Scripts]]
Utility scripts that help enhance the main projects. These include pre- and post-processing scripts, monkey patches, or any other tools that improve the behavior and usability of the projects.
- [Analysis Scripts](./analysis)
- [Enhancement Scripts](./enhancement)

### [[Data]]
All raw data associated with different projects and experiments.
- [Raw](./raw): Sets of raw data.
- [Processes](./processed): Analyzed and processed data.

### [[Notebooks]]
This folder contains notebooks for idea exploration and calculation experiments, particularly in **Mathematica** or **Jupyter** formats.
- [Exploratory Notebooks](./exploratory) Notebooks for exploring different ideas, simulations, and approaches
- [Educative Notebooks](./educative) These notebooks provide better understanding of topics.
- [Workflows](./workflows) These notebooks are workflows of an specific project.

## Git Submodules

Some directories in this repository are **git submodules**, representing larger projects or collaborations with different people or organizations. These submodules are managed separately from this central repository to maintain modularity and organization.

## How to Contribute

This repository is primarily for personal and collaborative work, but suggestions and contributions are always welcome. Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or offer feedback on the organization or content.

## Setting Up

To get started, clone the repository and initialize the submodules:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/thisismeamir/num-rel-hub.git
```

For more specific instructions, see the individual project folders inside `src/`.
