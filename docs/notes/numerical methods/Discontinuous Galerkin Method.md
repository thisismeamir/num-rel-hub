The **Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Method** is a numerical technique for solving differential equations, similar to the Galerkin method but with a key difference: the solution is allowed to be discontinuous across element boundaries. This makes the method particularly well-suited for problems involving complex geometries, shocks, or discontinuities, such as those encountered in **fluid dynamics** and **hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs)**.

### 1. **Key Differences from Standard Galerkin Method**

In the standard Galerkin method (used in **finite element analysis**, for example), the solution is typically required to be **continuous** across the entire domain. The **Discontinuous Galerkin Method** allows the solution to be piecewise continuous within each element, but **discontinuous** between elements. This means:
- The domain is divided into subdomains (or elements), and in each subdomain, the solution is approximated using local basis functions.
- There is no requirement that the solution matches exactly at the boundaries between subdomains.

The DG method combines aspects of **finite volume** and **finite element methods**, providing high flexibility while still retaining accuracy.

### 2. **Core Idea**

The main idea of the Discontinuous Galerkin method is to solve the PDE in each element (subdomain) independently and then enforce **weak continuity** across the element boundaries through the use of **numerical fluxes** and **penalty terms**. This weak continuity ensures that even though the solutions may be discontinuous at the boundaries, the physical principles governing the PDE are still satisfied in an average or integral sense.

### 3. **Formulation of the Discontinuous Galerkin Method**

Consider a simple one-dimensional PDE for demonstration:

$$
\frac{du}{dx} = f(x)
$$

In the DG method, we:
- **Divide the domain** into elements $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ for $i = 1, \dots, N$.
- **Approximate the solution** $u(x)$ in each element using local basis functions $\phi_i(x)$, but without requiring continuity between the elements.

#### Steps:
1. **Local Approximation**: In each element, the solution is represented as a linear combination of local basis functions, for example:
   $$
   u_N(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i \phi_i(x)
   $$
   where the coefficients  $c_i$ are different for each element.

2. **Weak Formulation**: The PDE is integrated against test functions (which could be the same as the basis functions) over each element. For a differential operator $\mathcal{L}$, the weak form in an element $K$ would be:
   $$
   \int_K \mathcal{L}(u_N) \phi_j \, dx = \int_K f(x) \phi_j \, dx
   $$
   where $\phi_j$ are the basis functions in the element $K$.

3. **Numerical Fluxes**: To deal with the discontinuity between elements, **numerical fluxes** are introduced at the boundaries of the elements. These fluxes approximate the interaction between adjacent elements and ensure stability and accuracy. The numerical flux $\hat{f}(u^+, u^-)$ depends on the values of the solution from both sides of the boundary (i.e., $u^+$ from the current element and $u^-$ from the neighboring element).

4. **Penalty Terms**: To enforce stability, penalty terms may be added to penalize large jumps between elements at the boundaries.

### 4. **Advantages of the Discontinuous Galerkin Method**

- **Flexibility**: The DG method can handle complex geometries and irregular meshes more easily than continuous methods, due to the flexibility of allowing discontinuities.
- **Locality**: Since the solution is discontinuous, each element can be solved somewhat independently, making the method highly parallelizable and well-suited for modern computing architectures.
- **Handling Discontinuities**: It is particularly effective for problems with sharp gradients, shocks, or discontinuities, such as in fluid dynamics (e.g., solving Euler equations for compressible flow).
- **High-Order Accuracy**: DG methods can achieve high-order accuracy by increasing the number of local basis functions in each element.

### 5. **Applications of Discontinuous Galerkin Method**

- **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)**: DG methods are widely used in CFD to model compressible flows and other problems involving shock waves or discontinuities.
- **Electromagnetics**: In electromagnetics, DG methods can handle wave propagation problems in complex domains.
- **Hyperbolic PDEs**: DG is particularly effective for hyperbolic PDEs, which often model wave propagation, fluid dynamics, and other time-dependent phenomena where discontinuities or shocks are present.

### 6. **Mathematica Example: Simple DG Method**

Let’s use **Mathematica** to demonstrate a basic setup of the DG method for a 1D problem.

Consider the same differential equation:

$$
\frac{du}{dx} = -1, \quad u(0) = 0, \quad u(1) = 0
$$

1. **Define the Domain and Basis Functions**:

We divide the domain into two elements: $[0, 0.5]$ and $[0.5, 1]$. In each element, we will use a local linear basis function.

```mathematica
(* Define the two subdomains *)
subdomain1 = {x, 0, 0.5};
subdomain2 = {x, 0.5, 1};

(* Define the local basis functions for each element *)
phi1[x_] := x (1 - x)
phi2[x_] := (x - 0.5) (1 - x)

(* Local approximations in each element *)
u1[x_] := c1 phi1[x];
u2[x_] := c2 phi2[x];
```

2. **Define the Residuals and Weak Form**:

For each element, we calculate the residual and enforce the weak formulation.

```mathematica
(* Residuals in each element *)
residual1 = D[u1[x], x] + 1;
residual2 = D[u2[x], x] + 1;

(* Weak formulation: Integrate residuals over the elements *)
eqn1 = Integrate[residual1 * phi1[x], {x, 0, 0.5}] == 0;
eqn2 = Integrate[residual2 * phi2[x], {x, 0.5, 1}] == 0;
```

3. **Numerical Fluxes**:

We now compute the numerical flux at the interface $x = 0.5$. In the DG method, this is where we enforce the conditions to deal with the discontinuity between the two elements.

```mathematica
(* Define the numerical flux at the interface (x = 0.5) *)
fluxInterface = (u1[0.5] + u2[0.5])/2; (* Average flux *)

(* Add penalty terms to ensure stability at the interface *)
penalty = (u2[0.5] - u1[0.5]);
```

4. **Solve for Coefficients**:

We solve for the coefficients $c_1$ and  $c_2$ by solving the weak form equations and flux continuity.

```mathematica
(* Solve the system of equations for c1 and c2 *)
sol = Solve[{eqn1, eqn2, fluxInterface == 0, penalty == 0}, {c1, c2}]
```

5. **Plot the Solution**:

Finally, we plot the solution in each subdomain.

```mathematica
(* Substitute solution and plot *)
uSol1[x_] = u1[x] /. sol;
uSol2[x_] = u2[x] /. sol;

Plot[{uSol1[x], uSol2[x]}, {x, 0, 1}, PlotRange -> All, 
 PlotLabel -> "Discontinuous Galerkin Approximation"]
```

In this example, we:
- **Divided the domain** into elements.
- **Approximated the solution** within each element using local basis functions.
- Introduced **numerical fluxes** and **penalty terms** to handle discontinuities at the interfaces.
- Solved the system of equations and plotted the **discontinuous solution**.
