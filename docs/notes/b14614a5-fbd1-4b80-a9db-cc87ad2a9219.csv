In a right-angled triangle, one angle is 90 degrees. The sum of all interior angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.

## Step 2: Calculate the remaining interior angle
Since we know two of the sides and it's stated that the triangle is right-angled with legs of length $\sqrt{2}$ and $1$, let's denote the third angle as $x$. Then, using the fact that the sum of all angles in a triangle equals 180 degrees: $90 + x + y = 180$ where $y$ would be the remaining angle, not specified. However, for a right-angled triangle, we already know one angle is 90 degrees and we are given lengths for two sides which allows us to consider if these can form a specific type of triangle with particular ratios.

## Step 3: Determine the relationship between sides based on Pythagoras theorem
For any right-angled triangle with legs $a$ and $b$, and hypotenuse $c$, Pythagoras' Theorem states that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Given our specific case, we can use this to see if there is a right triangle with sides $\sqrt{2}$ and $1$.

## Step 4: Evaluate the given information for consistency
The lengths of the sides are in an arithmetic progression: $a-d, a, a+d$, which implies that $a - d = \sqrt{2}, a = 1, a + d = 3$. It seems there's a misunderstanding because if one leg is $\sqrt{2}$ and another is $1$, then the lengths don't fit an arithmetic progression as described. Thus we need to correct our approach.

## Step 5: Correctly identify side lengths for this specific right triangle
Given that one of the legs has length $\sqrt{2}$, if this were part of a right-angled triangle with an integer or simple radical sides in an arithmetic sequence and the other leg is $1$, then we should realize our earlier setup was not consistent.

## Step 6: Re-analyze what's given
We are told there's a specific progression for side lengths $(a-d, a, a+d)$ but that doesn't fit with having sides $\sqrt{2}$ and $1$. Given the confusion above, let's clarify how the arithmetic sequence applies",11.232549905776978

The statement about an arithmetic progression for the triangle's sides was a misunderstanding. A correct identification should be made that the given lengths $\sqrt{2}$ and $1$ do not form a straightforward arithmetic sequence as initially stated.

## Step 8: Find the appropriate value of a using Pythagoras' theorem
Given a right-angled triangle with legs $\sqrt{2}$ and $1$, we can use Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse, which would give us an idea about how these lengths relate in terms of the arithmetic sequence.

## Step 9: Calculate the length of the hypotenuse.
Using Pythagoras' theorem, $(\text{hypotenuse})^2 = (\sqrt{2})^2 + 1^2$.

## Step 10: Solve for the hypotenuse
$(\text{hypotenuse})^2 = 2 + 1$, therefore $\text{hypotenuse} = \sqrt{3}$.

## Step 11: Recognize that our goal was actually finding a, but in relation to how these numbers fit into an arithmetic sequence.
Since we have $a - d = \sqrt{2}, a = 1,$ and $a + d = \sqrt{3},$, then we can solve for a using the fact that it is known that the hypotenuse of this triangle is $\sqrt{3}$, which means our earlier setup needs correction.

## Step 12: Correctly identify a
Since one leg is $\sqrt{2}$ and the other is $1$ with a hypotenuse of $\sqrt{3}$ doesn't fit directly into an arithmetic progression but we know that in this specific right triangle with side lengths given, our main goal was to find ""a"", which actually corresponds to the middle value of this arithmetic sequence.

## Step 13: Solve for d
Using $a-d = \sqrt{2}, a + d = \sqrt{3}$, solve for d. Given that we know the relationship between these three numbers and have been asked to find 'a', we will use this information in conjunction with our knowledge of arithmetic sequences.

## Step 14: Calculate ""d"" from $a - d$ and $a + d$
$(a-d) = \sqrt{2}$ and $(a+d) = \sqrt{3",11.783990144729614
