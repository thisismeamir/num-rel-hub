# Introduction
Relativistic astrophysics focuses on the most energetic and extreme astrophysical events, characterized by extremely high velocities, intense gravitational fields, scorching temperatures, and extraordinarily strong magnetic fields.

Such conditions are typically found in the vicinity of neutron stars and black holes. As a result, a genuinely general relativistic approach is essential to accurately capture the physical phenomena at play.

In this setting, relativistic magnetohydrodynamics provides a powerful framework for describing the behavior of macroscopic plasma under relativistic conditions. This framework applies not only to astrophysical scenarios but also to other extreme environments, such as heavy ion collisions.

In the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation, plasma is modeled as a macroscopic fluid that interacts with electromagnetic fields—both those generated by its own dynamics and any external fields that might be present. Additionally, in astrophysical fluids, the collision times between particles are typically much shorter than other relevant timescales of the system. This separation of scales allows astrophysical plasma to be treated as a continuous medium, with well-defined macroscopic quantities like velocity, density, and pressure.

This theory is frequently applied to explore the dynamics of phenomena like the collision of two magnetized neutron stars, which can result in a gamma-ray burst, or the processes of accretion and outflows around a central compact object. In these scenarios, general relativistic effects are crucial, often playing a dominant role. As a result, solving the complete set of General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) equations is the only way to achieve a precise and physically consistent description of such systems.

# Covariant General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic equations
The GRMHD equations can be derived after imposing the [[Continuity Equation]] and [[Energy Momentum Tensor Conservation]], namely the [[Bianchi Identities]]:

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla_\mu \tilde J^\mu = \nabla_\mu \rho u^\mu = 0 \\ \nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu} =0
\end{align}
$$

Here $\nabla_\mu$ is the covariant derivative of the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$, $\rho$ is the rest-mass density and $u^\mu$ is the four-velocity of the fluid. We continue by introducing $h_{\mu\nu}$, the projector operator orthogonal to $u^\mu$.

$$
h_{\mu\nu} := u_\mu u_\nu + g_{\mu\nu}
$$
and such that
$$
h_{\mu\nu} u^\mu = 0
$$
So then it is realizable (How?) that the energy momentum tensor conservation is four equations representing the conservation of energy:
$$
u_\nu \nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}= 0
$$
and four equations representing the conservation of four-momentum:
$$
h_{\alpha\nu} = \nabla_\mu T^{\mu\nu}
$$
Note that the total energy-momentum is the linear combination of the contributions coming from the matter and from the electromagnetic fields:
$$
T^{\mu\nu} = T^{\mu\nu}_{\text{matter}} + T^{\mu\nu}_{\text{fields}}
$$
where:
$$
\begin{align}
T^{\mu\nu}_{\text{matter}} &:= \rho h u^\mu u^\nu + p g^{\mu\nu}
\\
T^{\mu\nu}_{\text{fields}} &:= F^\mu_\lambda F^{\lambda\nu} - \frac14(F^{\lambda\delta}F_{\lambda\delta})g^{\mu\nu}
\end{align}
$$
Here $h$ is the specific enthalpy which is:
$$
h:= 1 + \epsilon + \frac p\rho
$$
where $\epsilon$ is the specific internal energy and $p$ is the pressure of the fluid. Also $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the [[Faraday tensor]]. Because electric and magnetic fields are available within the system we must have  the corresponding conservation laws, namely, the Maxwell Equations:
$$
\nabla_\mu F^{\mu\nu} = \mathcal{J}^\mu
$$
and
$$
\nabla_\mu \!^*F^{\mu\nu}= 0
$$
Where $\mathcal{J}^\mu$ is the charge current density, and $\!^*F^{\mu\nu}$ is the dual of the Faraday tensor. The Faraday tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from the electric and magnetic fields, as measured in the generic frame having $U^\alpha$ as tangent vector:
$$
F^{\mu\nu} = U^\mu E^\nu - U^\nu E^\mu - \sqrt{-g} \eta^{\mu\nu\lambda\delta} U_\lambda B_\delta
$$
where $\eta^{\mu\nu\lambda\delta}$ is the fully anti-symmetric symbol and $g$ is the determinant of the spacetime four-metric. The dual Faraday tensor is then:
$$
\!^*F^{\mu\nu} := \sqrt{-g}\eta^{\mu\nu\lambda\delta}F_{\lambda\delta}
$$
which is written as:
$$
\!^* F^{\mu\nu} = U^\mu B^\nu - U^\nu B^\mu + \sqrt{-g}\eta^{\mu\nu\lambda\delta}U_\lambda E_\delta
$$
Most of GRMHD simulations to date have explored scenarios within the so-called "ideal GRMHD" where the electrical conductivity is assumed to be infinite.

This can be a very good approximation because in astrophysical plasmas, the conductivity is actually very large. Under these conditions, the electric charges are infinitely effective in canceling any electric flied, which are therefore, zero in the frame co-moving with the fluid:
$$
F^{\mu\nu}u_\nu = 0
$$
The main consequence of the condition is that the electric fields cease to be independent vector fields and can be obtained from simple algebraic expressions involving the fluid four-velocity and the magnetic fields. 

Specially after defining the electric and magnetic four-vectors in the fluid frame as:
$$\begin{align}
e^\mu &:= F^{\mu\nu}u_\nu\\
b^\mu &:= F^{\mu\nu}u_\nu 
\end{align}
$$
with the constraints that
$$
e^\mu = 0
$$
and that the co-moving magnetic field is fully spatial:
$$
u_\mu b^\mu = 0
$$
Under these conditions we can write the Faraday and its dual tensors as:
$$
\begin{align}
F^{\mu\nu} &= \sqrt{-g}\eta^{\mu\nu\lambda\delta} u_\lambda b_\delta\\
\!^*F^{\mu\nu} &= b^\mu u^\nu - b^\nu u^\mu
\end{align}
$$
We can write the total energy-momentum tensor in terms of the vectors $u^\mu$ and $b^\mu$ as:
$$
T^{\mu\nu} = \rho h_{\text{tot}} u^\mu u^\nu + p_{\text{tot}} g^{\mu\nu} - b^\mu b^\nu
$$
where $p_{\text{tot}} := p + \frac{b^2}{2}$, which now includes the magnetic pressure:
$$
p_{\text{mag}}:= \frac12 b^\mu b_\mu = \frac 12 b^2
$$
while the total enthalpy is given by:
$$
h_{\text{tot}} := h + \frac{b^2}{\rho}
$$
Note that the square of the magnetic-field strength in the fluid frame also satisfies the following identity $b^2 = B^2 - E^2 > 0$, which is sometimes used as physical constraint in numerical evolutions. Finally, it is useful to express the current density $\mathcal{J}^\mu$ into two components, convection term and a conduction term. 
$$
\mathcal{J}^\mu = qn^\mu + J^\mu
$$
