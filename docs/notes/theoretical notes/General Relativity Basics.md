General relativity is the human finest understanding of the phenomena known as gravitation. Developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 to 1915, the theory explains gravitation as a 4 dimensional tensor-field equation. This theory was established after gravitation couldn't be plugged in [[Special Relativity]].
