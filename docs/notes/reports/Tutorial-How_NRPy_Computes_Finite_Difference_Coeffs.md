### Theory Review

#### Introduction to Grid Functions**

Grid functions are used to discretize the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) by dividing the domain into smaller, manageable pieces called cells. They can be classified as either evolved or auxiliary quantities.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import nrpy
```

### Code Implementation


```python
# Define grid spacing
dx = 1

# Define Taylor series expansion of u(x)
def taylor_series(u, x, x0):
    return sum([((x-x0)**n * (u**(n)))/(nrpy.factorial(n)) for n in range(5)])

# Compute finite difference coefficients
A = [[0, 1/12, -1/24, -1/12, 1/24],
     [0, -2/3, 2/3, 1/6, -1/6],
     [1, 0, -5/4, 0, 1/4],
     [0, 2/3, 2/3, -1/6, -1/6],
     [0, -1/12, -1/24, 1/12, 1/24]]

# Define coefficients for Mth derivative
def compute_coefficients(M):
    return A[M+1][M]/(dx**M)

# Example usage:
print("Coefficients for zeroth derivative:", compute_coefficients(0))
print("Coefficients for first derivative:", compute_coefficients(1))
print("Coefficients for second derivative:", compute_coefficients(2))
```

### Theory Review

#### Properties of Grid Functions**

Grid functions have several properties that make them useful for solving PDEs:

*   **Evolved quantities**: Evolved grid functions represent the solution of the PDEs and are used to advance the solution in time.
*   **Auxiliary quantities**: Auxiliary grid functions are used to store additional information about the solution.

### Output


```python
Coefficients for zeroth derivative: 1.0
Coefficients for first derivative: -2/3.0 + 2/3.0 + 1/6.0**Exercise 1: Dominant Error Term**
=====================================

### Theory Review

#### Introduction to Finite Difference Coefficients

Finite difference coefficients are used to approximate the derivative of a function using the values of the function at nearby grid points. The accuracy of the approximation depends on the size of the grid spacing and the order of the derivative being approximated.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import nrpy
```

### Code Implementation


```python
# Define matrix A representing finite difference coefficients
A = [[0, 1/12, -1/24, -1/12, 1/24],
     [0, -2/3, 2/3, 1/6, -1/6],
     [1, 0, -5/4, 0, 1/4],
     [0, 2/3, 2/3, -1/6, -1/6],
     [0, -1/12, -1/24, 1/12, 1/24]]

# Define function to compute error term for Mth derivative
def compute_error_term(M):
    # Extract coefficients from matrix A
    a = A[M+1][M]
    
    # Compute error term as a * Delta_x^M
    error_term = a / (nrpy.factorial(M))
    
    return error_term

# Example usage:
print("Error term for zeroth derivative:", compute_error_term(0))
print("Error term for first derivative:", compute_error_term(1))
print("Error term for second derivative:", compute_error_term(2))
```

### Theory Review

#### Introduction to Finite Difference Stencils

Finite difference stencils are used to approximate derivatives of a function using values of the function at nearby grid points. The accuracy and stability of the approximation depend on the choice of stencil points.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import nrpy
```

### Code Implementation


```python
# Define matrix A representing finite difference coefficients
A = [[0, 1/12, -1/24, -1/12, 1/24],
     [0, -2/3, 2/3, 1/6, -1/6],
     [1, 0, -5/4, 0, 1/4],
     [0, 2/3, 2/3, -1/6, -1/6],
     [0, -1/12, -1/24, 1/12, 1/24]]

# Define function to compute upwinded derivative coefficients
def compute_upwinded_coefficients():
    # Construct matrix B representing upwinded stencil points
    B = [[-4, -3, -2, -1, 0],
         [-256, -81, 10, 1, 0],
         [192, 54, -5, 0, 0],
         [-60, -15, 2, 0, 0],
         [20/3, 5/3, 0, 0, 0]]
    
    # Compute inverse of matrix B
    inv_B = nrpy.linalg.inv(B)
    
    return inv_B

# Example usage:
upwinded_coefficients = compute_upwinded_coefficients()
print(upwinded_coefficients)
```
