**Google Tag Manager Script**
=============================

### Overview of the Code

This code snippet is a Google Tag Manager (GTM) script used to track website analytics and events. It initializes the GTM library, sets up data layers, and configures tracking.

```javascript
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-59152712-8"></script>
```

This line loads the GTM JavaScript file from Google's servers.

### Code Implementation

#### Initializing GTM Library

```javascript
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
gtag('js', new Date());
```

This code initializes the GTM library by creating a `dataLayer` array and defining a `gtag()` function that pushes arguments onto the data layer. The `gtag('js', new Date())` line is called to initialize the GTM script.

#### Configuring Tracking

```javascript
gtag('config', 'UA-59152712-8');
```

This line configures tracking for the specified Google Analytics property ID (`UA-59152712-8`). This sets up the GTM library to send data to this property.

### Mathematical Background

The `dataLayer` array is used to store event and transaction data that will be sent to Google Analytics. The `gtag()` function is used to push arguments onto the data layer, which are then processed by the GTM library.

$$\label{mathematical_background}$$

Let $E$ be the event or transaction being tracked, and let $P$ be the Google Analytics property ID. Then we can define the following mathematical relationship:

$$
gtag('config', P) \implies E \in P
$$

### Example Use Cases

*   Tracking website analytics using GTM.
*   Configuring tracking for specific events or transactions.

#### Notes on GTM Script

The GTM script is used to track various types of data, including page views, events, and conversions. The `gtag()` function can be called with different arguments to configure tracking for specific scenarios.

### Tips and Tricks

*   Use the GTM script to track website analytics and events.
*   Configure tracking for specific events or transactions using the `gtag()` function.

#### Checking Tracking Setup

To check if the GTM script is set up correctly, you can verify that the `dataLayer`**NRPy+'s Reference Metric Interface**

================================

### Overview of the Code

This section provides an explanation on how to define a reference metric using NRPy+. The code for defining a reference metric is located in the file `reference_metric.py`.

### Theory Review

#### Introduction to Reference Metrics

A reference metric is a mathematical object that describes the geometry of a problem. It is used as input to numerical relativity codes and provides information about the underlying physical system.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import cmdline_helper as cmd
```

This code imports the `cmdline_helper` library from NRPy+, which provides functions for defining reference metrics.

### Code Implementation

#### Defining a Reference Metric

To define a reference metric, you need to create an instance of the `ReferenceMetric` class and specify its properties. This can be achieved using the following code:

```python
# Define the reference metric
ref_metric = cmd.ReferenceMetric()
```

This will create an empty reference metric object.

#### Specifying Coordinate System

Next, you need to specify the coordinate system used by the reference metric. You can do this by calling the `set_coord_system` method:

```python
# Specify the coordinate system
ref_metric.set_coord_system("Cartesian")
```

This sets the coordinate system to Cartesian coordinates.

#### Defining Metric Components

You also need to define the metric components of the reference metric. This can be achieved by calling the `add_metric_component` method:

```python
# Define metric component for x
ref_metric.add_metric_component("x", "gxx", 1)
```

=====================================

### Overview of the Code

This section provides an explanation on how to define reference metrics in NRPy+. The code for defining a reference metric is located in the file `reference_metric.py`.

### Theory Review

#### Introduction to Reference Metrics

A reference metric is a mathematical object that describes the geometry of a problem. It is used as input to numerical relativity codes and provides information about the underlying physical system.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import cmdline_helper as cmd
```

This code imports the `cmdline_helper` library from NRPy+, which provides functions for defining reference metrics.

#### Coordinate Systems

NRPy+ assumes that all curvilinear coordinate systems map directly from a uniform, Cartesian numerical grid with coordinates $(x,y,z)$=(`xx[0]`,`xx[1]`,`xx[2]`). This means that when defining reference metrics, all defined coordinate quantities must be in terms of the `xx[]` array.

### Code Implementation

#### Defining Orthogonal Coordinate Scale Factors

As described on Wikipedia ([curvilinear coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear_coordinates)), the $i$th scale factor is the positive root of the metric element $g_{ii}$. In ordinary spherical coordinates $(r,\theta,\phi)$, with line element $ds^2 = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j = dr^2+ r^2 d \theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2\theta \ d\phi^2$, we would first define

*   $r = xx_0$
*   $\theta = xx_1$
*   $\phi = xx_2$

so that the scale factors are defined as

*   `scalefactor_orthog[0]` = 1
*   `scalefactor_orthog[1]` = r
*   `scalefactor_orthog[2]` = r sin θ

Here is the corresponding code:

```python
import sympy as sp

This code imports the `matplotlib.pyplot` library.

### Code Implementation

#### Creating a Legend

To add a legend to a plot, you need to use the `legend()` function. This function takes several arguments that control the appearance and position of the legend:

```python
# Create a legend
legend = ax.legend(loc='upper left', shadow=True, fontsize='x-large')
```

This code creates a legend with the following properties:

*   `loc`: The location of the legend is set to `'upper left'`, which means it will be displayed at the top-left corner of the plot.
*   `shadow`: A shadow effect is added to the legend, giving it a 3D appearance.
*   `fontsize`: The font size of the legend is set to `'x-large'`, making it easier to read.

#### Understanding Legends in NRPy+

Legends are an essential tool for interpreting plots. They provide additional information about the data being plotted and help users understand the relationships between different variables.

### Mathematical Background

The concept of legends is based on the idea of displaying data visually. In NRPy+, this can be done using various libraries such as `matplotlib`.

$$\label{mathematical_background}$$

Let $P$ be a set of plotted data, and let $\vec{x}$ be a vector representing the coordinates. Then we can define the following mathematical relationship:

$$
P = \left( x, y \right)
$$

where $x$ and $y$ are the components of the vector.

### Example Use Cases

*   Adding a legend to a plot using `legend()`.

Radial inversion is a common issue that arises when working with spherical or hyperbolic coordinate systems. It occurs when the radial coordinate becomes negative, which can cause numerical instabilities and errors in the simulation.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
xxmin = [sp.sympify(0), sp.sympify(0), -M_PI]

### Theory Review

#### Introduction to Coordinate Transformations

Coordinate transformations are a fundamental concept in mathematics and physics, used to describe changes in coordinate systems. In this case, we will explore how the positivity of certain coordinates can simplify these transformations.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
x = sp.symbols('x')
y = sp.symbols('y')

# Define a function for calculating the distance between two points
def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):

# Calculate the distance between two points in the Cartesian plane
cartesian_distance = distance(x, y, 0, 0)
print("Cartesian Distance:", cartesian_distance)

# Calculate the distance between two points in polar coordinates
polar_distance = distance(sp.cos(x), sp.sin(x), 1, 0)
print("Polar Distance:", polar_distance)
```

This code defines a function for calculating distances between two points and calculates the distance between two points in both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems.

### Code Implementation

#### Simplification due to Positivity of Coordinates

When certain coordinates are positive, it can simplify the calculations involved in coordinate transformations. For example:

```python
# Define variables
x = sp.symbols('x')
y = sp.symbols('y')

# Define a function for calculating the distance between two points in cylindrical coordinates
def cylindrical_distance(x, y):
    return sp.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

# Calculate the distance between two points in cylindrical coordinates when x and y are positive
cylindrical_distance_positive = cylindrical_distance(sp.cos(x), sp.sin(x))
print("Cylindrical Distance (positive):", cylindrical_distance_positive)
```

This code defines a function for calculating distances in cylindrical coordinates when x and y are positive, which simplifies the calculation compared to the general case.

# Set the first subplot to be a polar axes
ax1 = plt.axes(projection='polar')

# Set the maximum radius
ax1.set_rmax(2)

# Remove radial grid lines and labels
ax1.set_rgrids(r,labels=[])

# Set theta values for plotting
thetas = np.linspace(0,360,24, endpoint=True)

# Remove x, y, and z tick labels from the 3D axes
ax2.set_xticklabels([])
ax2.set_yticklabels([])

# Define variables
r = 1.0  # positive cylindrical radial coordinate
theta = np.pi / 4  # angular coordinate

# Calculate x and y coordinates
x = r * np.cos(theta)
y = r * np.sin(theta)

print("x:", x)
print("y:", y)
```

This code assumes a positive cylindrical radial coordinate `r` and calculates the corresponding Cartesian coordinates `x` and `y`.

### Overview of Defining Constants and Vectors

This section provides an explanation on how to define constants and vectors using SymPy.

### Theory Review

#### Introduction to SymPy

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It allows us to perform mathematical operations with symbols, rather than numbers. This makes it possible to work with equations and expressions that contain variables and parameters.

### Defining Constants

We can define constants using the `sp.symbols` function:

```python
xx[0] = sp.symbols("xx0", real=True)
```

This line defines a constant `xx0` as a symbol, which is a mathematical object that represents an unknown value. The `real=True` argument indicates that `xx0` should be treated as a real number.

### Defining Vectors

We can define vectors using lists:

```python
xxmin = [sp.sympify(0), -M_PI, sp.sympify(-1)]
xxmax = [sp.sympify(1),  M_PI, sp.sympify(+1)]
```

These lines define two vectors `xxmin` and `xxmax`, which represent the minimum and maximum values of the x-coordinate. The `sp.sympify` function is used to convert the numerical values to SymPy symbols.

### Defining Parameters

We can define parameters using the `Cparameters` class:

```python
AMPLRHO, SINHWRHO, AMPLZ, SINHWZ = par.Cparameters("REAL",thismodule,
                                                   ["AMPLRHO","SINHWRHO","AMPLZ","SINHWZ"],
                                                   [     10.0,       0.2,   10.0,    0.2])
```

This line defines four parameters `AMPLRHO`, `SINHWRHO`, `AMPLZ`, and `SINHWZ` as real numbers with values 10.0, 0.2, 10.0, and 0.2, respectively.

Now that we have understood the theory behind converting Cartesian to SinhCylindrical coordinates, let's implement it in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import newton

# Define variables
Cartx = 1.0  # x-coordinate in Cartesian system
Carty = 2.0  # y-coordinate in Cartesian system
xx0 = 3.0  # radial distance in SinhCylindrical system
theta = 4.0  # angle in SinhCylindrical system
z = 5.0     # z-coordinate in SinhCylindrical system

# Define function for Newton-Raphson method
def f(xx):
    rho = xx[0]
    theta_cyl = xx[1]
    z_cyl = xx[2]
    
    return [rho - np.sqrt(Cartx**2 + Carty**2) * np.sin(theta_cyl),
            theta_cyl - np.arctan2(Carty, Cartx),
            z_cyl - z]

### Overview of Converting Cartesian to SinhCylindrical Coordinates

This section provides an explanation on how to convert Cartesian coordinates to SinhCylindrical coordinates using the `atan2` function.

### Theory Review

#### Introduction to Angle Calculation

In order to perform the conversion, we need to calculate the angle between the x-axis and the position vector in the Cartesian system. This can be done using the `atan2` function, which is a more robust version of the `atan` function for calculating angles in the range $[-\pi, \pi]$.

$$
\theta = \text{atan2}(y,x)
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the x-axis and the position vector, and $(x,y)$ are the coordinates in the Cartesian system.

### Code Implementation

#### Converting Cartesian to SinhCylindrical Coordinates with Python

Now that we have understood the theory behind converting Cartesian to SinhCylindrical coordinates, let's implement it in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
Cartx = 1.0  # x-coordinate in Cartesian system
Carty = 2.0  # y-coordinate in Cartesian system

# Calculate angle using atan2 function
theta = sp.atan2(Carty, Cartx)

print("Angle (theta):", theta)
```

This code uses the `sp.atan2` function from SymPy to calculate the angle $\theta$ between the x-axis and the position vector.

### Theory Review

#### Advantages of Using `atan2` Function

The `atan2` function has several advantages over other methods for calculating angles:

*   **Robustness**: The `atan2` function is more robust than the `atan` function, as it can handle cases where $x=0$ or $y=0$.
*   **Range**: The `atan2` function returns an angle in the range $[-\pi, \pi]$, which makes it easier to perform calculations involving angles.

### Example Use Cases

*   **Converting Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates** using the `atan2` function.
*   **Calculating angles between vectors** using the `atan2` function.**Converting SinhCylindrical to Cartesian Coordinates**

    "NewtonRaphson": [lambda xx: RHOCYL*sp.cos(PHICYL),
                      lambda xx: RHOCYL*sp.sin(PHICYL),
                      lambda xx: ZCYL],
}

xx_to_Cart = [RHOCYL*sp.cos(PHICYL), RHOCYL*sp.sin(PHICYL), ZCYL]

# Convert SinhCylindrical to spherical coordinates
xxSph = [sp.sqrt(RHOCYL**2 + ZCYL**2),
         sp.acos(ZCYL / xxSph[0]),
         PHICYL]

               [-sp.sin(PHICYL), sp.cos(PHICYL), sp.sympify(0)],
               [sp.sympify(0),  sp.sympify(0),  sp.sympify(1)]]

```python
par.set_parval_from_str("reference_metric::CoordSystem","SinhCylindricalv2")

rfm.reference_metric()

sp.pretty_print(sp.simplify(rfm.GammahatUDD[2][2][2]))

#### Introduction to Scatter Plots

A scatter plot is a type of plot that displays the relationship between two variables by plotting individual data points on a grid. It is often used to visualize correlations or relationships between variables.

$$
\begin{align*}
x &= \sin(t) \\
y &= \cos(t)
\end{align*}
$$

where $t$ is the independent variable.

### Code Implementation

plt.scatter(x, y)
```

This code creates a scatter plot of the sine and cosine functions.

### Theory Review

#### Setting the Aspect Ratio


```python
ax.set_aspect('equal')
```

This code sets the aspect ratio of the plot to be equal, so that one unit in x is equal to one unit in y. This is useful for creating plots where the relationship between variables is not linear.

### Code Implementation


```python
# Create a sample plot with unequal aspect ratio
t = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
x = np.sin(t)
y = np.cos(t)

plt.scatter(x, y)

#### Introduction to Saving a Plot

Saving a plot allows you to preserve the plot for later use or to share with others. This can be done by using the `savefig()` function, which saves the plot as an image file.

$$
\begin{align*}
x &= \sin(t) \\
y &= \cos(t)
\end{align*}
$$

where $t$ is the independent variable.

### Code Implementation


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Create a sample plot
t = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
x = np.sin(t)
y = np.cos(t)

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.grid()

# Save the plot to a file
plt.savefig("Cartgrid.png", dpi=300)
```

This code saves the scatter plot as an image file named "Cartgrid.png" with a resolution of 300 DPI.

### Theory Review

#### Introduction to Displaying a Plot

Displaying a plot allows you to view the plot in real-time. This can be done by using the `show()` function, which displays the plot in a new window.

y &= \cos(t)
\end{align*}
$$

where $t$ is the independent variable.

### Code Implementation

y &= \cos(t)
\end{align*}
$$

where $t$ is the independent variable.

### Code Implementation

### Overview of Closing a Plot

This section provides an introduction to closing a plot using the `close()` function in Matplotlib.

### Theory Review

#### Introduction to Closing a Plot

Closing a plot is necessary when you are done working with it. This can be done by using the `close()` function, which closes the current figure and all its axes.

$$
\begin{align*}
x &= \sin(t) \\
y &= \cos(t)
\end{align*}
$$

where $t$ is the independent variable.

### Code Implementation


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Create a sample plot
t = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
x = np.sin(t)
y = np.cos(t)

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.grid()

# Close the current figure and all its axes
plt.close(fig)
```

This code closes the current figure and all its axes after creating a sample scatter plot.

### Theory Review

#### What is `fig`?

In Matplotlib, `fig` is an alias for the current figure. When you close a figure using `plt.close(fig)`, it actually closes the current figure and all its axes.

$$
\begin{align*}
x &= \sin(t) \\
y &= \cos(t)
\end{align*}
$$

where $t$ is the independent variable.

### Code Implementation


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Create a sample plot
t = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
x = np.sin(t)
y = np.cos(t)

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.grid()

# Get the current figure
fig = plt.gcf()

# Close the current figure and all its axes
plt.close(fig)
```

This code gets the current figure using `plt.gcf()` and then closes it using `plt.close(fig)`.

### Theory Review

#### What happens when you close a plot?

When you close a plot, Matplotlib will:

*   **Remove the plot from memory**: The plot is removed from RAM, which can help free up resources.
*   **Close all its axes**: All the axes in the figure are closed, which means they will no longer be available for use.

### Example Use Cases

*   **Visualizing data in 2D space** using Sinh-Cartesian coordinate systems.
*   **Performing numerical computations** with Sinh-Cartesian coordinate systems.

#### Pushing the Outer Boundary

The Sinh-Cartesian coordinates allow us to push the outer boundary of the computational domain a lot further away, while keeping reasonably high resolution. This is because the hyperbolic functions used in Sinh-Cartesian coordinates grow much slower than trigonometric functions, allowing for more efficient use of computational resources.

#### Increasing Resolution Towards the Center

The Sinh-Cartesian coordinates allow us to increase the resolution towards the center of the computational grid. This is because the hyperbolic functions used in Sinh-Cartesian coordinates can be made more accurate near the origin, allowing for a finer mesh size.

$$
\begin{align*}
x(xx_0) &= \text{AMPLXYZ} \left[\frac{\sinh\left(\frac{xx_0}{\text{SINHWXYZ}}\right)}{\sinh\left(\frac{1}{\text{SINHWXYZ}}\right)}\right]\ ,\\

### Overview of Setting Default Values

This section provides an introduction to setting default values for the minimum and maximum values of x, y, and z.

### Theory Review

#### Introduction to Min and Max Values

In any coordinate system, it is necessary to define the minimum and maximum values of each dimension. This allows us to specify the range of values that each variable can take on.

$$
\begin{align*}
x_{min} &= -1 \\
x_{max} &= 1 \\
y_{min} &= -1 \\
y_{max} &= 1 \\
z_{min} &= -1 \\
z_{max} &= 1
\end{align*}
$$

### Code Implementation


```python
import sympy as sp

# Set default values for min and max (x,y,z)
xxmin = [sp.sympify(-1), sp.sympify(-1), sp.sympify(-1)]
xxmax = [sp.sympify(+1), sp.sympify(+1), sp.sympify(+1)]

print("Default values for min and max (x,y,z):")
print("xxmin:", xxmin)
print("xxmax:", xxmax)
```

This code sets the default values for the minimum and maximum values of x, y, and z.

### Theory Review

#### Using SymPy to Represent Min and Max Values

In this example, we use SymPy to represent the min and max values as sympy expressions. This allows us to perform symbolic computations with these values.

$$
\begin{align*}
xxmin &= [-1, -1, -1] \\
xxmax &= [1, 1, 1]
\end{align*}
$$

### Code Implementation


```python
import numpy as np
import sympy as sp

# Set default values for min and max (x,y,z)
xxmin = sp.Matrix([-1, -1, -1])
xxmax = sp.Matrix([+1, +1, +1])

print("Default values for min and max (x,y,z):")

```

This code declares the basic parameters of the coordinate system and their default values using the `Cparameters` function from Paraview.

### Theory Review

#### Using Cparameters Function

The `Cparameters` function is used to declare basic parameters of the coordinate system and their default values. The function takes four arguments:

*   **Module Name**: The name of the module that defines the parameter.
*   **Parameter Names**: A list of parameter names to declare.
*   **Default Values**: A list of default values for each parameter.

This section provides an introduction to setting the parameters for the Sinh-Cartesian transformation.

### Theory Review

#### Introduction to SINH Parameters

The SINH (Sinh-Hyperbolic) transformation is a mathematical function that maps points in 3D space to a new coordinate system. The parameters of this transformation are crucial in determining the accuracy and behavior of the mapping.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{SINH} &= \text{Sinh-Hyperbolic transformation} \\
&= \text{mapping function for points in 3D space}
\end{align*}
$$

### Code Implementation


```python
# Import necessary modules
import numpy as np

# Set SINH parameters
AMPLXYZ = 1.0  # amplitude parameter
SINHWXYZ = 1.0  # sinh width parameter
```

### Theory Review

#### Understanding the Parameters**

The SINH transformation has two key parameters:

*   **Amplitude (AMPL)**: This parameter determines the scale of the mapping.
*   **Sinewidth (SINH)**: This parameter controls the width of the hyperbolic function used in the mapping.

### Code Implementation


```python
# Define a function to calculate SINH values
def sinh_values(x, y, z):
    return np.sinh((x**2 + y**2 + z**2)**0.5 / AMPLXYZ)
```

### Theory Review

#### Using SINH Values in the Transformation**

The `sinh_values()` function calculates the Sinh-Cartesian coordinates for a given point (x, y, z). The result is used as input to the mapping function.

### Code Implementation


```python
# Define the mapping function
def map_point(x, y, z):
    sinh_x = sinh_values(x, 0, 0)
    sinh_y = sinh_values(0, y, 0)
    sinh_z = sinh_values(z, 0, 0)
    
    return [sinh_x, sinh_y, sinh_z]
```

### Theory Review

#### Mapping Points with the SINH Transformation**

The `map_point()` function uses the Sinh-Cartesian coordinates calculated by `sinh_values()` to map a point (x, y, z) to its new coordinate system.There is no text provided for me to explain. Please provide the markdown document you would like me to explain, and I will be happy to assist you.

&= 1.0
\end{align*}
$$

The number of points is an important parameter in many mathematical transformations. It determines the granularity of the output and can affect the accuracy of the results.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{N} &= \text{number of points} \\
&= \text{integer value}
\end{align*}
$$

### Code Implementation

N = 100  # set number of points to 100
```

### Theory Review

#### Relationship Between Number of Points and Resolution**

The number of points is related to the resolution of the output. A higher number of points typically results in a higher-resolution output, but may also increase computation time.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Resolution} &= \frac{\text{N}}{\text{Total Area}} \\
&= \text{units per unit area}
\end{align*}
$$

### Code Implementation


```python
# Use relationship between number of points and resolution in a mathematical equation

### Assumptions

We assume that the same point is being sampled at different locations within the grid. This means that the number of points is not necessarily equal to the total number of cells in the grid.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{N} &\neq \text{Total Cells} \\
&= \text{integer value}

### Theory Review

#### Introduction to Distribution Along the (x,y)-Directions**

The distribution along the (x,y)-directions is an important concept in many mathematical transformations. It determines the way that points are distributed within a grid.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Distribution} &= \text{way that points are distributed} \\
&= \text{function of x and y coordinates}
\end{align*}
$$

### Code Implementation


```python
# Define the number of points along the (x,y)-directions
Nxxs = 24  # set number of points in each direction to 24

# Generate an array of evenly spaced values from -1 to 1
xxis = np.linspace(-1, 1, Nxxs, endpoint=True)
```

### Theory Review

The `np.linspace()` function is used to generate an array of evenly spaced values within a specified range. In this case, we are generating an array of x-coordinates.

$$
\begin{align*}
x_{i} &= \text{x-coordinate at index i} \\
&= \text{evenly spaced value between -1 and 1}
\end{align*}
$$

&= \text{grid of points that are evenly spaced}
\end{align*}
$$

### Assumptions

for i in range(Nxxs):
    axis_ticks.append(SINHA * (np.exp(xxis[i] / SINHW) - np.exp(-xxis[i] / SINHW)) / \
                        (np.exp(1.0 / SINHW) - np.exp(-1.0 / SINHW)))
```

### Theory Review

#### Using Sinh-Cartesian Coordinates to Compute Axis Ticks**

The `axis_ticks` list is used to store the computed axis ticks. The `for` loop iterates over each point in the `xxis` array, and for each point, it evaluates the x and y coordinates using the Sinh-Cartesian transformation.

$$
\begin{align*}
x_{i} &= \text{x-coordinate at index i} \\
