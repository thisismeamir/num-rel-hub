# Numerical Relativity Hub - `data/`

This folder holds the raw data generated from simulations, experiments, or external sources. Each project-specific dataset is stored in its respective folder.

## Navigating

- [Raw](./raw): Sets of raw data.
- [Processes](./processed): Analyzed and processed data.

Data is organized by project, and processed data is often moved to the `processed/` sub-folder for further analysis.

Data management guidelines:
1. Add raw data into the appropriate project folder.
2. Use descriptive file names to ensure clarity.
3. If processing data, consider creating a `processed/` folder within the respective project data folder.
