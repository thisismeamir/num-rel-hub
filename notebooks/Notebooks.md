# Notebooks (`notebooks/`)

This folder contains interactive notebooks for **idea exploration** and **Mathematica calculations**. These notebooks serve as a space for quick experimentation and proof-of-concept work.
## Navigating:
- [Exploratory Notebooks](./exploratory) Notebooks for exploring different ideas, simulations, and approaches
- [Educative Notebooks](./educative) These notebooks provide better understanding of topics.
- [Workflows](./workflows) These notebooks are workflows of an specific project.

These notebooks are meant for experimentation and brainstorming, and can later be formalized into source code or reports.

How to contribute:
1. Add new notebooks under the relevant subfolder (either `exploratory` or `mathematica`).
2. Clearly annotate notebooks for easy understanding.
3. If an idea is formalized, consider moving relevant code to `src/`.
